Sparse Arrays Hackerrank

There are N strings. Each string’s length is no more than 20 characters. There are also Q queries. For each query, you are given a string, and you need to find out how many times this string occurred previously.

Input Format

The first line contains N, the number of strings.
The next N lines each contain a string.
The N+2nd line contains Q, the number of queries.
The following Q lines each contain a query string.

Constraints


1<=N<=1000 
1<=Q<=1000 
1<=length of any string <=20 

Sample Input

4
aba
baba
aba
xzxb
3
aba
xzxb
ab

Sample Output

2
1
0

Explanation

Here, “aba” occurs twice, in the first and third string. The string “xzxb” occurs once in the fourth string, and “ab” does not occur at all.

    for i in range(len(queries)):
        count.append(strings.count(queries[i]))
    
    return count

    strings_count = int(input())

    strings = []

    for _ in range(strings_count):
        strings_item = input()
        strings.append(strings_item)

    queries_count = int(input())

    queries = []

    for _ in range(queries_count):
        queries_item = input()
        queries.append(queries_item)

    res = matchingStrings(strings, queries)

    fptr.write('\n'.join(map(str, res)))
    fptr.write('\n')

    fptr.close()
